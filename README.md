# Approximate Heavy Tails in Finite Sample Stochastic Gradient Descent

This is a repository provides source code for the [Approximate Heavy Tails in Finite Sample Stochastic
Gradient Descent](www.arxiv.com) paper.

## Dependencies

To install the minimal dependencies needed to use the algorithms, run in the
main directory of this repository

```commandline
